You must pick the mechanism by which you install TensorFlow. The supported choices are as follows:
    "native" pip
    Anaconda

Native pip installs TensorFlow directly on your system without going through a virtual environment. Since a native pip installation is not walled-off in a separate container, the pip installation might interfere with other Python-based installations on your system. However, if you understand pip and your Python environment, a native pip installation often entails only a single command! Furthermore, if you install with native pip, users can run TensorFlow programs from any directory on the system.
In Anaconda, you may use conda to create a virtual environment. However, within Anaconda, we recommend installing TensorFlow with the pip install command, not with the conda install command.


Installing with native pip
If neither of the following versions of Python is installed on your machine, install it now:
Python 3.5.x 64-bit from python.org
Python 3.6.x 64-bit from python.org
-TensorFlow supports Python 3.5.x and 3.6.x on Windows. Note that Python 3 comes with the pip3 package manager, which is the program you'll use to install TensorFlow.


To install TensorFlow, start a terminal. Then issue the appropriate pip3 install command in that terminal. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
C:\> pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
Installing with Anaconda


The Anaconda installation is community supported, not officially supported.
Take the following steps to install TensorFlow in an Anaconda environment:
Follow the instructions on the Anaconda download site to download and install Anaconda.
Create a conda environment named tensorflow by invoking the following command:

C:> conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:
C:> activate tensorflow
 (tensorflow)C:>  # Your prompt should change
Issue the appropriate command to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment. To install the CPU-only version of TensorFlow, enter the following command:
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow
To install the GPU version of TensorFlow, enter the following command (on a single line):
(tensorflow)C:> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
